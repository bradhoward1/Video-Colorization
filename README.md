# Video Colorization
This repository contains software that aims to colorize black and white videos. Courtesy of Richard Zhang (https://github.com/richzhang/colorization), we 
have obtained a machine learning algorithm that is able to colorize black and white images without any user input. Our goal is to break down videos into their
individual frames, apply this algorithm on each frame, and acquire a recolorized video as a result. Depending on the progress of the project, we may need to 
utililze segmentation methods in order to better colorize individual components of each frame.
